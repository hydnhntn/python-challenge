# Calculate the following:
# The total number of months included in the dataset
# The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#
# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
